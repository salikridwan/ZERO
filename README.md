> **ZERO** is a certifiable safety abstraction layer that enforces deterministic behavior in high-criticality systems, sitting cleanly between user applications and the underlying operating system. It transforms hardware and system-level nondeterminism—such as timing drift, resource contention, and interrupt variability—into predictable, auditable coordination patterns.

---

## 🚀 Why ZERO?

- **Deterministic Execution:**  
  Drift-aware execution control and physics-based fingerprinting ensure identical timelines across devices/runs.
- **Certified Safety:**  
  Built for certifiability in safety-critical environments—no kernel mods required.
- **Hardware Agnostic:**  
  Portable and lightweight; works with RTOS or general-purpose OSes.
- **Fail-Operational by Design:**  
  For domains where failure is not an option: avionics, robotics, autonomous infra.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Temporal-Causal Correctness:**  
  Enforces correct ordering of events across distributed components.
- **Drift-Aware Execution:**  
  Compensates for hardware clock drift and system timing anomalies.
- **Physics-Based Fingerprinting:**  
  Enables reproducible, auditable system behavior.
- **Failure Cataloging:**  
  Identifies and documents system-level failure modes at the abstraction boundary.
- **Zero Kernel Dependencies:**  
  No modifications to underlying OS kernels required.

## 📊 Current Status: Pre-Development Benchmarking

> **Active Measurement Phase**  
> *No code yet!* We are busy building a deep empirical foundation before implementation.

- 🕒 Characterizing clock drift anomalies  
- 📨 Stress-testing temporal message validation  
- 📚 Building failure catalogs

## 📖 Background & Vision

**ZERO** is engineered for the next generation of safety-critical systems, enabling predictable, auditable, and certifiable behavior in complex environments.  
We believe that robust, deterministic software is a *prerequisite* for trustworthy autonomy.
